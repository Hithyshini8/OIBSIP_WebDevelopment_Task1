# OIBSIP_WebDevelopment_Task1
I built as part of my internship at Oasis Infobyte. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It includes a responsive layout and intuitive interface.

# 🧮 Calculator – OIBSIP Level 2 Task 1

## 📋 Project Overview

This is a **basic calculator** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** as part of the **Web Development and Designing Internship (OIBSIP)** by **Oasis Infobyte**. The calculator is capable of performing fundamental mathematical operations such as:

- ➕ Addition  
- ➖ Subtraction  
- ✖️ Multiplication  
- ➗ Division  

It offers a clean, interactive interface for input and output display and includes all essential functional buttons like clear (`C`) and backspace (`⌫`).

## ✨ Features

- User-friendly interface
- Interactive number and operator buttons
- Real-time input and output display
- Clear and backspace functions
- Responsive layout using **CSS Grid**
- Lightweight and fast performance

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

- **HTML** – To create the structure of the calculator
- **CSS** – To style the interface and use grid layout for button arrangement
- **JavaScript** – To handle logic using:
  - `eventListeners`
  - `if-else` conditions
  - Arithmetic operators
  - Basic DOM manipulation

---

## 🖥️ How It Works

The calculator interface includes:
- A display screen to show input and result
- Buttons for digits and operators
- Clear and delete functions

JavaScript handles user interactions through event listeners, which trigger functions to update the display and perform calculations as users press the buttons.
